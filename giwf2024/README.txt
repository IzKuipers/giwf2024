Game In Windows Forms 2024 (giwf2024)

Yet another silly attempt at creating a game using Windows Forms in C#. This time actually succeeding quite effectively, despite the fact that it's nowhere near finished.

It was written using:
- Windows XP Service Pack 3, and
- Visual Studio Enterprise 2010

(Both with legitimate licenses, by the way)

This game really doesn't have much of a plan. Its idea was just to see what I could do on .NET framework 4, running primarily on an OS older than me. I still know my way around the OS though, I'm no stranger to Windows XP or any other version of Windows for that matter.
